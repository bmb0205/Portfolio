> the Skeleton bridge can now continue its evolution without having side-effects on Materialize bridge project
Materialize bridge can (and should) continue its evolution without waiting on Skeleton bridge. The only guidance I would like to add this: the Materialize Catalog (blue green box extracted from the bridge to run as a standalone application hosted at Github) is a valuable marketing and teaching tool. This further implies that
you may define the order developing wrappers that allows easy "enrichment" you your product's blue green box with native controls being used as the parts of its UI.
add the complete (but empty of any actual content) help section as soon as I add it to the skeleton bridge repository (which I hope have in place no later than tomorrow)

Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to
be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live
inside the repository but are specific to one user's workflow) should go into
the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.
