                    For reasons best kept within a college application essay, I had dreamed of becoming a doctor since I was a boy. After
                    obtaining a B.S. in Biochemistry from Virginia Tech, I chose a similar but different path and spent two
                    years getting an M.S. in <a class="link--binf" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"
                        target="_blank">Bioinformatics</a> from UNC Charlotte. The first year, I was the only employee at a nanotechnology
                    start up of two people. Although the work was highly interesting, I soon traded in my pipettes and lab
                    gloves to put 100% of my focus on programming.

                    I learned how to program in various languages during my education, and loved the constant problem solving and satisfaction
                    that came with even little accomplishments. Although I loved the sciences and the field of bioinformatics,
                    various reasons lead me to turn my focus to a broader view of the world of programming.

                    In early 2016, I taught myself web application development at home while finishing my final semester in school. Although
                    programming did consume my life day and night for this period of my life (sorry, Lily, I love you!), I learned an
                    incredible amount and found building tools and applications that other people could use incredibly
                    exciting. Today, software engineering is my passion and I am a full stack software developer in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have an amazing and loving girlfriend (the aforementioned Lily), and the best
                    cat in the world, Ella.
